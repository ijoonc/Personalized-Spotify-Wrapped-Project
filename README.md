Spotify listeners’ music patterns change on a frequent basis, but it’s often difficult to gauge the extent of these changes. The current ***Spotify Wrapped Experience*** provides an annual analytical summary with limited information into the user’s music trends. Our tutorial is designed to give users the opportunity to gain insights into their music patterns at various time intervals, rediscover old songs, and explore tracks of interest.  

Our tutorial is designed for those who crave a deeper understanding of their music habits and possess an intrinsic desire to learn about Python programming, specifically in the fields of **data visualization**, **data analysis**, and **API utilization**. The audience should have taken at least an introduction computer science course in Python, is familiar with Python, Git, and Jupyter environments, and have **access to a Spotify account**.  

Some libraries and technological tools we use are the following: **Spotify API**, **Spotipy**, **Git**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, **Seaborn**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Datetime**, **JSON**, **Math**, **Sys**, and **OS**. 

Some vocabulary to take note of are the **Different Types of APIs**, **Rate Limits**, **Client Credentials Flow**, **API Tokens**, **API Requests**, **Built-In Spotipy Commands**, **Pie Charts**, **Heat Maps**, and **Histograms**.
